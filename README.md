# MyWebsite
My first personal Website in which I will implement HTML/CSS and JS. I will most likely use Frameworks like Bootstrap and Angular.

My goal here is to have a website that I can deploy myself or on a hosting service and to have as a main source of contact. 
It is also a HUB for me to see how far I have come and what I am able to do. 

I will use the Website to link or deploy my own projects on it.
